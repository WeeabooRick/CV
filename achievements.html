    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>UKIE Games Jam 2018: Worked as part of a five-man team to create a game in 36 hours. Our final game was the winner on campus and because a full ranking of games was not released, we assume we made it into the top 10!</li>
        <li>Global Games Jam 2019: While working as team we were provided with the theme ‘what home means to you’ and we created a simulation game based around being homeless and performing different tasks to earn money and survive.</li>
        <li>Released Redacted: As part of a third-year module, we were tasked with creating a working mobile game on Android. I was pleased with what I had managed to make, so I decided to polish it to a standard where I could release on the Google Play Store!</li>
        <li>Professional Gains Mobile Game: Working on behalf of a client both me and friend were asked to create a mobile game aimed at children and highly promoting his brand and the idea of health eating.</li>
